I converted the CSV file to json.
I succceded displaying all images
I did not succeed displaying images according to catagory. As my Json file outputs values for keys in one row & random order, devided by commas. it is not possible to use slice.
I worked with following Jquery classes:
jQuery.grep() 
jQuery.filter()
jQuery.map()
Array.prototype.filter()
Array.prototype.every()
The output is responsive.
Thanks for the challenge
